    <h2>Donations is what keeps us developing!</h2><br />
    <br />
    <p>
        Thank you for considering to donate!<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Here at Hot Hash Games to support the cost of many different things! The costs of 
        hosting this website, our developer fees for Apple's App Store and the Google Play
        store cost quite a bit. Also, I am just a software developer with no artistic skills
        at all, so donations also help bring more content in the form of characters, 
        backgrounds, stages, and music to our video games.
